An office has a single shared printer used by several departments. Documents pile up while the printer is busy. The system must: • Process documents in arrival order (FIFO) • Allow urgent documents to be inserted at the front of the queue • Show how many documents are pending • Cancel the last document added if it was sent by mistake
